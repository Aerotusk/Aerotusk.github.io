Fade-in animation for the planets

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction (dotted line with evenly spaced dots, each one getting progressively dimmer until a floor value)
    Nevermind on the dots/dashes, they look awful. Still might be able to do the dimming using a bunch of circles, though

Add some quiet sounds on hover over planets

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk

Make the solar system rotatable (stretch goal)

Make Jupiter/Saturn into a project portfolio/ongoing projects repository?
