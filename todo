Fade-in animation for the planets (or, finally add in a "landing" page to force interaction so the planet hover sound can play)

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction (dotted line with evenly spaced dots, each one getting progressively dimmer until a floor value)
    Nevermind on the dots/dashes, they look awful. Still might be able to do the dimming using a bunch of circles, though
    + Use conic gradients, relatively new to CSS

Add some quiet sounds on hover over planets (Not working atm, "promise" to not play sounds until interaction but hover doesn't count :/ )

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk

Make the solar system rotatable (stretch goal)

Mobile version of the site LMAOOOOO

Add velocity to planet/list animations so they feel a bit more natural

Redo the grow/shrink code so it runs smoother and can be used for absolutely any object (instead of just planets)
    ohhhh, maybe need to redo orbitAnimate so it changes planet coordinates instead of using translate/transform
    Also, maybe change the image origins to be at image center so growing and shrinking is easier? (transform-origin = center) WOW that would simplify things lol (and would have been really nice to know)
