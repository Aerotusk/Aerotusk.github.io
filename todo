Starry background - create one that will tile seamlessly as you scroll down the page, so pages can be as long as desired
    (why did I just get déjà vu while thinking about how this project will turn out? Is it because it's in HTML?)

Fade-in animation for the planets - will need to learn JavaScript?

Pull and cache planetary orbit data from Horizons (maybe also add rotation period?)

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction (dotted line with evenly spaced dots, each one getting progressively dimmer until a floor value)
    Nevermind on the dots/dashes, they look awful. Still might be able to do the dimming using a bunch of circles, though

Slightly increase size of planets on hover
    Okay, this is a little bit broken. Doing it in the css :hover pseudoclass makes the planets jitter a tiny bit on hover, likely due to the animation
    Try making this a js function?

Add some quiet sounds on hover over planets

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk

WHEN am I going to stop focusing on the main screen and start adding content smh

Find a way to clean up the main page .html source

Make the solar system rotatable

Make Jupiter/Saturn into a project portfolio/ongoing projects repository?

Make js function to animate planet movement on focus
