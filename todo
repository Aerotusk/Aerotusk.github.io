Starry background - create one that will tile seamlessly as you scroll down the page, so pages can be as long as desired
    (why did I just get déjà vu while thinking about how this project will turn out? Is it because it's in HTML?)

Fade-in animation for the planets - will need to learn JavaScript?

Planet alignment on screen - At first just want to show their orbits and place them randomly. Eventually want to have their orbits update in semi-real-time

Make planet icons look better - probably more comical looking, and probably fewer pixels (maybe need to make them vector graphics, or find a way to turn off anti-aliasing?)

Pull and cache planetary orbit data from Horizons (maybe also add rotation period?)

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk
