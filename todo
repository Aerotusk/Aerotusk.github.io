Fade-in animation for the planets

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction (dotted line with evenly spaced dots, each one getting progressively dimmer until a floor value)
    Nevermind on the dots/dashes, they look awful. Still might be able to do the dimming using a bunch of circles, though

Add some quiet sounds on hover over planets (Not working atm, "promise" to not play sounds until interaction but hover doesn't count :/ )

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk

Make the solar system rotatable (stretch goal)

Fix social media button color - might need the svgs to be callable js functions (footer as a js function?)

Mobile version of the site LMAOOOOO

Add velocity to planet/list animations so they feel a bit more natural
