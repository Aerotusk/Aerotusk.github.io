Fade-in animation for the planets

Pull and cache planetary orbit data from Horizons (maybe also add rotation period?)

Make ellipses fade out in retrograde direction (dotted line with evenly spaced dots, each one getting progressively dimmer until a floor value)
    Nevermind on the dots/dashes, they look awful. Still might be able to do the dimming using a bunch of circles, though

Add some quiet sounds on hover over planets

Add moving shadows to the planets? Somehow idk

Find a way to clean up the main page .html source (even more so, since most of the code is identical for the first planet display)

Make the solar system rotatable (stretch goal)

Make Jupiter/Saturn into a project portfolio/ongoing projects repository?
